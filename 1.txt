  Last weekend,I participated in the volunteer assessment of Xiao Ling of Ming Density which is the only world cultural heritage in Nanjing.It was such a precious experience.
  The owner of the tomb was Zhu yuanzhang who was the first emperor and the founder of the Ming Dynasty.In the museum,there was a large mural of the whole view,plenty of works of art.They are all the symbol of history.So I could improve my knowledge by looking around. Inside the park,there were a few deer.I could not stop taking a close look at them. 
  During this exam,I met lots of excellent contemporaries.Although I have passed it successfully,I learned a lot from them.First,pay attention to every detail ,just like zipping up the coat well when guiding visitors.Second, try to be flexible when meeting problems instead of remaining silence.Third,take to things no matter you do first.This is so-called interest is the best teacher.
  The interview was over.I am now looking forward to be the volunteer work next month.Come on!
